# ACCESS-OM2-GMD-Paper-Figs

Jupyter notebooks to reproduce (as far as possible) the figures from the [ACCESS-OM2 model announcement paper (*GMD*, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020). These notebooks are mostly uncommented, but they should be functional. They are intended to demonstrate methods to undertake the calculations used in the paper.
